# diabetes_prediction

## Aims of the project
This repository is an example of prediction based on a diabetes questionaire dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/early-diabetes-classification). It will include a description of the data, its characteristics as well as two types of modeling.
- The first one will aim to be easilly implementable by a human in a clinical condition, i.e. we're trying to obtain an algorithm a human can easily follow and understand.
- The second one will not be bound by such limitations, we will in the end compare precisions in both cases.

## Description of data
Raw data countains 520 rows and 17 different observations.

Note that several rows are duplicate of each others. There is only 251 unique rows. Each row is duplicated at least once.
Although it might be due to several patients having exactly the same profile, this seems unlikely

No missing data in the dataset.

Except for age, all data is binary.
